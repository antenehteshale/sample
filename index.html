       <p>Hello! Welcome to my <em><strong>Anteneh Teshale's</strong></em> Personal WebSite. I am a photographer and videographer reisding in Hawassa, Ethiopia. I have been taking photos and videos since I was in eighth grade.
         </p>
        <p>I have a deep passion of becoming Filmmaker (Specially Travel Film Maker). In addition of having a passion of becoming film maker, I have also deep passion of becoming programmer since I was in Elementary School. So, I am here now! Building My own personal website from scratch.</p>
